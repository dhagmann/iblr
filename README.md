# iblr
This R library implements the Instance Based Learning Theory model proposed by Gonzalez, Lerch, and Lebiere Manos (2003).

It contains two primary functions:  
* **ibl_simulation** simulates data based on parameters about  
* **ibl_fitting** estimates the best-fitting model parameters for experimental data.

## Installation
Install the latest version with:

```R
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("dhagmann/iblr", build_vignettes = FALSE)
```

## Getting Started
To run a simulation, first define the model parameters, then run the simulation function.
```R

```

You can recover the initial parameters (with some noise) using the fitting function.
```R

```
